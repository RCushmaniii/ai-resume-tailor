## Overview

AI Resume Tailor is a bilingual (EN/ES) SaaS application that helps job seekers understand exactly why Applicant Tracking Systems reject their resumes and what to do about it. Users paste a resume and a job description, and the system returns a structured analysis: a 0-100 match score, missing keywords with severity coding, and actionable optimization suggestions.

The product runs a React 19 frontend with a Flask backend, self-hosted on a Hetzner VPS behind Caddy. OpenAI GPT-4 handles analysis through ATS-focused prompts with structured JSON output. Authentication flows through Clerk (Google, LinkedIn, email/password), payments through Stripe embedded checkout, and user data through Neon serverless Postgres.

The design prioritizes zero friction — guests get 5 free analyses with no signup required — and privacy by architecture: no resume data is stored, all processing happens in a single request/response cycle.

## The Challenge

Over 75% of resumes are rejected by ATS software before a human recruiter ever sees them. Job seekers are submitting into a black box with no visibility into why they're being filtered out.

Existing tools either charge upfront, require account creation before showing value, or deliver generic advice ("use action verbs") that isn't tied to the specific job posting. The Latin American market is further underserved — Spanish-speaking job seekers get machine-translated afterthoughts instead of native-language analysis.

The result: job seekers waste time tailoring resumes by intuition, with no feedback loop telling them what's actually missing.

## The Solution

**Structured ATS Analysis:** The AI engine mimics enterprise ATS behavior (Taleo, Greenhouse) through carefully engineered prompts. GPT-4 returns structured JSON — match score, keyword gaps, severity-coded suggestions — parsed into type-safe TypeScript interfaces on the frontend.

**Zero-Friction Access:** Guest users get 5 free analyses before any signup prompt. The product delivers value first, asks for commitment second. Credit tracking uses local storage for guests with server-side validation for authenticated users.

**Bilingual by Design:** Full i18n coverage across every UI element, error message, and analysis output. English and Spanish are first-class citizens with localized industry terminology for both markets.

**Privacy-First Architecture:** No resume data is persisted. Analysis happens in a single request/response cycle. The trust model is simple — user data doesn't exist after the response completes.

## Technical Highlights

- **Structured JSON Output:** GPT-4 with strict JSON mode and low temperature (0.1) for deterministic, parseable responses
- **Type-Safe API Contract:** TypeScript interfaces with union types and transformation functions for backward compatibility across API versions
- **Modular Analysis Engine:** Separate scoring, keyword extraction, and suggestion modules — each independently testable
- **Severity-Coded UI:** Red/amber/blue visual hierarchy maps directly to AI output severity levels
- **Embedded Stripe Checkout:** Guest-to-paid conversion with post-payment account creation — no signup wall before purchase
- **Clerk Webhook Pipeline:** Automatic profile provisioning in Neon Postgres across all auth methods
- **Skeleton Loading States:** Layout-perfect skeletons matching final render dimensions — zero content layout shift

Test scenarios to try:

1. **Quick analysis** — Paste any resume and job description, click Analyze. No account required.
2. **Language switch** — Toggle to Spanish in the header to see full bilingual support.
3. **Severity coding** — Review the results to see critical (red), warning (amber), and tip (blue) suggestions.
