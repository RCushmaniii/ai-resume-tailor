# Roadmap

## Current (MVP)

- Resume vs job description analysis (text-only)
- Match score + breakdown
- Missing keywords + suggestions
- No accounts, no data storage

## Next (Candidate Enhancements)

- `job_url` ingestion (fetch + clean) as an optional input
- Export results (PDF)
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Caching to reduce repeated OpenAI calls

## Next (Committed)

- Bilingual UX (en/es) across all user-facing UI and docs surfaces (LatAm Language Layer)
